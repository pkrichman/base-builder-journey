# Base Notes

Base is a Layer 2 built on Ethereum, focused on:
- Low transaction fees
- Fast confirmations
- Onboarding everyday users onchain

My goal is to learn how Base enables real-world use cases
through simple and accessible onchain tools.
## Why Base

Base makes onchain building accessible
by lowering costs and reducing friction for developers.
